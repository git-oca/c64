# MINI-FRAMEWORK

This is a mini framework you can use to create one-file-demo for the Commodore 64.
This is the framework I used myself for the Demo "Tweaked".

The framework should help for :

- Sequencing the different parts of the demo (called the sequences)
- Sequencing effects inside a single sequence
- Hide the technical details about a stable IRQ (using the double IRQ technic)

Please check the provided examples to see how it works. It should be pretty strightforward.
