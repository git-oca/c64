These snippets are not meant to be perfect at all. This is just some code I wrote to learn coding for c64, that I'm happy to share here just in case that could help someone else to get started.These code snippets are far from perfect — they’re just stuff I put together while learning how to code for the C64. I'm sharing them here in case they might help someone else who's also getting started.
